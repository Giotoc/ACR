1. Requirements

You need to have following software on your box:
- Python in version 2.5 or newer - 3 branch is not working right now!
- MongoDB 1.6 or newer - ACR is tested on versions 1.4 to 1.8.1
- pymongo Python driver for MongoDB

Mongo is not required, but without it the functionality is limited to manipulating file system, sending emails and ObjectPath functionality.

Additionally you can have following Python modules (if ACF can't load them, there will be information about it in debug mode - see below)
- simplejson or json - install it if you want output in JSON. CJSON is not supported as of now.
