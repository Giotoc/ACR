1. Requirements

You need to have the following software on your box:
- Python in version 2.5 or newer (latest highly recommended) - Python 3 is not supported right now
- MongoDB 1.6 or newer - ACR is tested on versions 1.4 to 2.0.1
- pymongo Python driver for MongoDB (check which version is best for your MongoDB installation)

Mongo is not required, but without it the functionality is limited to manipulating file system, sending emails and testing ObjectPath.

Additionally you can have the following Python modules (if ACR can't load them, there will be information about it in debug mode - see below)
- simplejson or json - install it if you want output in JSON. CJSON is not supported as of now.

2. Installation

Unpack package to a directory of your choice.
